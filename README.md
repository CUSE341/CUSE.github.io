###Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a plug-in for moodle with the following features:
* First get the student and/or TA’s schedule to our website
* Export the student and/or TA’s schedule to google calendar
* Export the student and/or TA’s schedule to PDF or jpeg format
* If TA modifies the schedule (room/date/time changes/description on course), it will refresh on the student’s calendar. (Optional feature - if time permits, we will add it to our plug-in)
